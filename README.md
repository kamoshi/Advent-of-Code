# Advent of Code
My solutions to the Advent of Code in various programming languages

Each `year` directory can have multiple subdirectories dedicated to specific languages which I used to solve tasks for that year, and each `language` subdirectory can be further split into different days.


## Breakdown by languages

| Year | Primary language | Stars |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | Java | 6 |
| 2019 | Scala | 27 |
| 2020 | Python | 50 |
