# Advent of Code
My solutions to Advent of Code

Each **year** directory can have multiple subdirectories dedicated to specific languages, which I used to solve the tasks for that year.
Each **language** subdirectory can be further split into individual **days**.

## Main language used each year

| Year | Language | Stars |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 2018 | Java     | 6     |
| 2019 | Scala    | 27    |
| 2020 | Python   | 50    |
| 2021 | Python   | 30    |
| 2022 | Rust     | 50    |
| 2023 | Haskell  | ??    |
